1. **Framework Editor**: Complete editing system for coordinators
2. **Mobile Observation Form**: Basic observation capture
3. **Dashboard**: Progress tracking and metrics display
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS
5. **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety throughout application

### Needs Enhancement

1. **Data Persistence**: Currently in-memory, needs Firebase integration
2. **User Authentication**: No auth system implemented yet
3. **Offline Capabilities**: PWA features not yet implemented
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Basic metrics only, needs detailed reporting

### Missing Critical Features

1. **Firebase Integration**: Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions
2. **User Management**: Role-based access control
3. **Teacher Database**: Auto-population from SIS integration
4. **Bulk Import/Export**: CSV processing capabilities
5. **Email Notifications**: Follow-up system for observations
6. **API Integrations**: SIS, BigQuery, LMS connections

## Database Schema (Firestore) - TO BE IMPLEMENTED

### Collections Structure

```typescript
/users/{userId}
  - Basic user profile and permissions

/frameworks/{frameworkId}
  - ✅ Data structure defined and working in UI
  - ❌ Firebase persistence not implemented

/observations/{observationId}
  - ❌ Full implementation needed

/teachers/{teacherId}
  - ❌ Teacher database needed

/schools/{schoolId}
  - ❌ School hierarchy needed

/departments/{deptId}
  - ❌ Department structure needed

/analytics/{analyticsId}
  - ❌ Analytics tracking needed

/imports/{importId}
  - ❌ Bulk import tracking needed
```

### Security Rules Requirements

- Observers can only see their own observations
- Admins have full access
- Teachers can view observations about them (non-evaluative)
- Framework configs restricted to admins/coordinators

## Updated Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Current Status)

1. ✅ Framework configuration system with full editing UI
2. ✅ Mobile observation capture (basic)
3. ✅ Dashboard with progress tracking (basic)
4. ❌ **URGENT NEED**: Firebase authentication and data persistence

### Phase 2 (In Progress)

1. **NEXT PRIORITY**: Firebase integration for data persistence
2. **NEXT PRIORITY**: User authentication and role management
3. Enhanced mobile observation form with offline support
4. Teacher database and auto-population

### Phase 3 (Planned)

1. Advanced reporting and analytics
2. Bulk data operations and CSV import/export
3. API integrations (SIS, BigQuery, LMS)
4. Email notification system
5. PWA features and offline functionality

## Immediate Next Steps Required

### Critical Missing Infrastructure

1. **Firebase Setup** (URGENT)

```typescript
// Required Firebase services
- Firestore: Database for frameworks, observations, users
- Authentication: Email/password + Google SSO
- Cloud Functions: Data processing, notifications
- Hosting: Production deployment
- Cloud Storage: Media attachments
```

1. **Data Persistence** (URGENT)

```typescript
// Framework data needs to persist instead of in-memory storage
// Current FrameworkEditor saves to useState - needs Firebase integration
// Observation data needs Firestore collections
```

1. **User Authentication System** (HIGH PRIORITY)

```typescript
// Implement role-based access:
- Coordinators: Can edit frameworks (✅ UI ready)
- Observers: Can create observations (✅ UI ready)
- Admins: Full system access
- Teachers: View their observations
```

### Enhanced Features Ready for Integration

The Framework Editor now provides a **production-ready UI** for coordinators to:

- ✅ Edit framework metadata (name, description, status, version, tags)
- ✅ Manage sections (title, description, weight percentages)
- ✅ Create, edit, reorder, and delete look-fors/questions
- ✅ Assign framework alignments with color-coded categories
- ✅ Manage tags at both framework and question levels
- ✅ All changes validated and ready for database persistence

**This UI is ready to connect to Firebase immediately** - the data models are implemented and functional.
